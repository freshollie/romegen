# Romegen

Romain numerals generator and parsing API.

## Goals

As a backend software engineer, I ensure that my code is 100% unit test
covered. This provides maintainability and faster development through TDD.

I used ESLint to help with automated code formatting and checking.

## Development

`npm install` to install dependencies
`npm start` to start the server

## Testing

Testing is completed with `jest` and can be run with `npm test`

## Linting

Airbnb linting rules are used for this project, with eslint

run `npm run lint` to run lint tests
